# T1A1 - Workbook
### 1. **Research** the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must **describe** at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time. (6)

<br>

### 2. **Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet: 
* Packets
* IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
* Routers and Routing
* Domains and DNS   

### **Explain** how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet. (6)

The internet or "internetworking" is essentially a "packet switching" network for data. _Packets_ can be defined as a block of data shared across a network and are small segments of a larger message. Theoretically speaking, one computer could send data to another computer as a larger message, or unbroken line of bits. However, this becomes impractical when more than two computers are involved, as the long unbroken line of bits would have to finish sending before a third computer could send more information. Because of packet switching, a block of data can be transmitted into tiny packets and take different network paths to the same destination. This enables multiple connections to take place over the same network at the same time. 

So as to make sure that the packets do not get lost during transmission, the essential components of a packet consists of two main portions; a packet header, and a payload. The header contains information about the packet, such as the origins and destination _IP addresses_ (which works like computer's mailing address).

### 3. **Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
* TCP
* HTTP and HTTPS
* Web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

### **Explain** how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (6)

<br>

### 4. **Identify** THREE data structures used in the Python programming language and **explain** the reasons for using each. (6)

<br>

### 5. **Identify** TWO ways in which code is executed and **explain** how they are different. (6)

<br>
 
### 6. **Identify** TWO commonly used programming languages and **explain** the benefits and drawbacks of each. (6)

<br>
 
### 7.(i) **Identify** TWO ethical issues from the areas below and 
* List of topics containing ethical issues: 
    * Access to a userâ€™s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs)
    * Intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement
    * Criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism
    * GPS tracking data and other types of metadata, MAC addresses, hardware fingerprints
    * Freedom of thought, conscience, speech and the media
    * Aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers
    * Trading of shares on the stock exchange OR crypto-currencies   
### **Discuss** the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue. (6)    

<br> 

### 7.(ii) For each ethical issue **identify** a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and **discuss** whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way. (6)

<br>

### 7. (iii) **Research** into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen and **discuss** how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches. (6)
